  <b>Texture VAE</b><br>
</h1>

Experiments generating textures using Variational Autoencoders (VAE).

VAEs have the benefit of fast inference, making them suitable to be deployed in the browser or games.


### Basic Requirements
* Python >= 3.8
* PyTorch >= 1.10.2
* Linux OS
* CUDA compatible GPU

### Installation
```
# create venv and install dependencies
make setup

# download the training data
wget https://build-fitid-s3-bucket-download.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/motesque/bricks1000.zip
unzip bricks1000.zip

```

### Configuration
```
model:
  latent_dims: 32
  texture_size: 128
  kl_weight: 0.7
lr: 1e-4
epochs: 500
snapshots: "../snapshots"
train_images: "../bricks1000"
logs:
  logdir: "../tb/runs"
  experiment_name: "default"
```

### Usage
```
cd texture_vae
python train.py -c config.yml
```

Tensorboard
```
make tb
```
Http Dev Server with ONNX runtime
```
make http
```

## Training Notes
The training images have been compiled from high-res Creative Commons Brick Textures sourced at [Texture Ninja](https://www.texture.ninja)
Each high-res texture was randomly cropped into 128x128 images using `cli/crop_gen.py`

### Sampled Bricks

* Latent code size does not have a dramatic effect. 32 seems to be enough
* The KLD weigthing has a huge influence on the sampling quality. While a lower value
  does improve reconstruction, the sampled images are of bad quality then.
